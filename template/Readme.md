# Mcg.Webservice.Api Solution

## Prerequisites (Windows Only)

- Ensure **[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install)** is installed.

- Install **[GNU Make 4.2.1](https://chocolatey.org/packages/make)**:

  ```shell
   Windows PowerShell
   Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

   PS C:\> choco install make -y
  ```

- _(Optional)_ **[cmder](https://cmder.net/)** A very handy, convenient terminal for Windows.  I find it useful when working with the `dotnet` commandline.

  ```shell
   Windows PowerShell

   PS C:\> choco install cmder -y
  ```

## Prerequesites (All Platforms,)

- **[Dotnet Core 3.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1)**: This is the SDK used to build the solution.
- **[Coverlet](https://github.com/tonerdo/coverlet?WT.mc_id=-blog-scottha#coverlet)**: This will calculate code coverage when using the `make test` command.

  ```shell
   Windows PowerShell
   Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

   PS C:\> dotnet tool install --global coverlet.console
  ```

- **[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)**: for building and running the solution's container.
- **[Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)**: for editing of Readme files and Makefiles, though not absolutely necessary.
- (_Optional_) **[Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)**: If using Visual Studio, then you'll need 2019+ since it is required to open .NET Core 3.x-based solutions.
